# Training-Ground-Godot-No2

This contains a ground with :
targets
bots
walls
projectiles

The created projectiles are now minimly positioned out side the bots collision 2D.
The reason for this is to prevent the bot from firing through a wall.  Which was happening when origianly the walls were added.
