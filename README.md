# Training-Ground-Godot-No2

Godot 3.1
using GD script

This contains a ground with :
targets
bots
walls
projectiles

The created projectiles are now minimly positioned out side the bots collision 2D.
The reason for this is to prevent the bot from firing through a wall.  Which was happening when origianly the walls were added.



Added a C# script
Which in turn haves dependance on an Neural Network Package.

Have write workaround for problems in Mono and passing some of the objects to functions
